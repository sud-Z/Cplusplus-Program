    This project is a fairly basic command line app that can be used to calculate compound interest. It is object oriented, uses header files, and makes use of smart pointers. In this project, I beleive that I followed the rules of encapsulation and object oriented programming well. I used private class members and getters and setters instead of allowing instances of my class to acess the member data directly. 
    I think that my use of smart pointers could be improved. Due to my lack of industry programming experience at this point, I struggle with the concept of smart pointers. I understand that using smart pointers are better for memory leak prevention and overall program stability, but I find that using standard pointers would have been much easier and quickler, although I would have had to have been more careful. Figuring out how to pass a smart pointer as a parameter was the hardest part of this project for me. It took me many hours of research before I found the piece I was missing. What I learned from this is that using the C++ website or YouTube tutorials is the way to go for problem solving with C++. The freedom that C++ grants you makes it difficult to find help on your exact situation. 
    The use of smart pointers and practice with objects in C++ will be very useful in other projects now and for a long time in the future. Something in me has grown to like C++. I think that I'll be using it more often from here on out. 
    I always make a big effort to make my code readable and updateable. My approach to this is to avoid leaving in lines that were meant for testing, use descriptive variable and function names that follow a standard naming convention, and making as many operations into functions that I can within reason. This way everything in the code is easy to find and nicely compartmentalized.
